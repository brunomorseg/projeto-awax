#project-awax

One of my first project.

Project => HTML5,CSS3 and Javascript

In this project i made my first code in Javascript, after trying and trying all day.

But, i got it! Because i understood the function of 'display:none' and how I can use and manipulate it.

So, the javascript function is about 'display:none' and 'display:block/flex'.
